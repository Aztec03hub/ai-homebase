### Example Pattern Summary Entry:

**Avoidant Partner's Emotional Distance Strategies**

## 5. Summary

**Format Template:**

[Month] shows [overall relationship trajectory: progression/regression/stagnation] despite [continued/intensified/reduced] attachment challenges. [List 2-3 major relationship milestones or significant events]. While [Partner 1]'s [specific attachment style] patterns persist ([2-3 specific behavioral examples from the month]) and [Partner 2]'s [specific attachment style] behaviors continue ([2-3 specific behavioral examples from the month]), they're showing increased ability to:

1. [Specific growth area with concrete example from the month]
2. [Specific growth area with concrete example from the month]
3. [Specific growth area with concrete example from the month]
4. [Specific growth area with concrete example from the month]
5. [Specific growth area with concrete example from the month]

The month ends with [specific relationship status, immediate plans, or significant breakthrough/setback]. Their [level of awareness of patterns] combined with [specific actions taken or commitments made] suggests [realistic assessment: genuine potential/continued challenges/need for intervention] for developing earned secure attachment over time[, though/because] [honest assessment of work still needed].

**Required Elements:**
1. Overall relationship progression assessment (progression/regression/stagnation)
2. Major milestones or events from the time period (be specific)
3. Specific ongoing attachment challenges for each partner (with examples)
4. Numbered list of growth areas with concrete evidence from the month
5. Current status and trajectory (specific, not general)
6. Realistic assessment of potential for earned secure attachment
7. Honest acknowledgment of work still needed

**Example Phrases for Assessment:**
- "genuine potential for developing earned secure attachment"
- "significant barriers remain to achieving secure attachment"
- "pattern suggests need for professional intervention"
- "demonstrates capacity for growth despite entrenched patterns"
- "shows awareness without consistent behavioral change"

### Document Organization Order

1. **Title** - Clear identification of couple and time period
2. **Partner 1's Attachment Style** (with 6-8 detailed examples)
3. **Partner 2's Attachment Style** (with 6-8 detailed examples)
4. **Wonderful Connections & Healthy Growth** (with 8-10 positive examples)
5. **Key Attachment Patterns Summary** (consolidated patterns for each partner)
6. **Summary** (overall relationship assessment and trajectory)

**Transition Between Sections:**
- Each section should stand alone but reference patterns from other sections
- Use consistent terminology throughout
- Build complexity from individual examples to pattern summary
- End with forward-looking assessment based on all evidence presented

### Formatting Guidelines

#### Message Formatting
- **Bold** for section headers
- *Italics* for subsection descriptions or emphasis
- Timestamps in consistent format: (YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS AM/PM)
- Em dashes for analysis points that need separation
- Block quotes only for external sources, not messages

#### Analysis Guidelines
- Use attachment theory terminology accurately
- Connect specific behaviors to attachment patterns
- Avoid judgmental language
- Acknowledge both partners' perspectives
- Note patterns across multiple examples
- Include both immediate and long-term impacts

**Effective Analysis Components:**
1. **Behavior Identification**: What specifically happened
2. **Attachment Link**: How this relates to attachment style
3. **Pattern Recognition**: How this fits broader patterns
4. **Impact Assessment**: Effect on partner and relationship
5. **Context Consideration**: Triggers or circumstances
6. **Growth Notation**: Any progress or regression shown

**Example Analysis Paragraph:**
"This exchange demonstrates classic avoidant deactivation strategies. When Phil expresses need for closeness ('Can we make it Facebook official?'), Alyssa's 19-minute delay and minimal response ('Sure 😊') shows discomfort with public intimacy markers. This pattern of minimizing relationship milestones while privately expressing love reflects the avoidant struggle between wanting connection and fearing engulfment. The impact on Phil is evident in his follow-up messages seeking reassurance, triggering his anxious attachment system."

#### Context Requirements
- Include enough messages to show full interaction arc
- Note when messages are from different conversations
- Provide background for references to past events
- Explain relationship timeline when relevant
- Include resolution messages when available

### Handling Mixed Attachment Styles

When a partner shows significant features of multiple attachment styles:

1. **Primary vs. Secondary Features**
   - Identify the dominant pattern (most frequent/impactful)
   - Note secondary features that appear under specific triggers
   - Example: "Avoidant Attachment with Anxious Features"

2. **<Mixed attachment style name> Indicators**
   - Simultaneous contradictory behaviors
   - Rapid switching between attachment strategies
   - Trauma responses overriding attachment system
   - Inability to maintain consistent strategy

3. **Organization Approach**
   - Create separate sections for distinct patterns
   - Show how patterns interact or conflict
   - Note which triggers activate which pattern
   - Include examples of internal conflict

### Special Considerations

#### When Family is Involved
- Always include complete context about family members' roles
- Show how family dynamics trigger attachment responses
- Include any mentions of family patterns or history
- Note intergenerational transmission of attachment styles
- Include cultural factors that may influence attachment expression

**Example Family Pattern Documentation:**
- "Mother's doubts about partner triggered avoidant flight response"
- "Discovery that mother and grandmother met partners through same activity heightened anxious partner's fears"
- "Family's approach to conflict (silence/withdrawal) mirrors avoidant strategies"

#### For Complex Multi-Day Situations
- Use clear date headers to show progression
- Link related conversations across days
- Show how unresolved issues carry forward
- Include eventual resolutions even if days later

#### Sensitive Topics
- Include trigger warnings if needed
- Maintain respectful language about past trauma
- Show growth and healing when present
- Avoid graphic details unless essential for analysis

### Minimum Requirements per Person
