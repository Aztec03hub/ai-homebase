"When an avoidant woman says she needs space, please for the love of all things holy, give it to her. Give it to her without questioning whether it’s really what she needs or whether it’s good for her since, After all, she’s avoidant and connection is a part of being fully human. Don’t fucking do that. Space is also a natural, normal human need.

Every minute beyond the request during which the anxious attacher is expanding upon, clarifying, re-stating, adding to, or in any other way continuing to communicate about this topic to the avoidant attacher, is an erosion of trust.

You are proving to her that you don’t really value her needs as equal to your own. She just told you what she needed and here you are, still talking, still denying her need.""

then later:

"The anxious partner has to commit to developing self-soothing capacities while he gives his partner more space to feel safe and heard and that her needs are respected. He has to summon the patience to wait and quell the urge towards protest behaviour. He must also recognize that she can’t be his only outlet for nurturance and security in his life. He must learn to be both vulnerable and nurturing with other men, too."

I think it's bullshit, I really do. Space is something people can ask for, but it isn't automatically valid, that's utter nonsense. As humans, we're LUCKY to have space at any given moment. The idea that we can just take space whenever we need/want is some modern neo-therapeutic bullshit. A person doesn't just get to DEMAND something from ANYONE, and the thought of saying "you MUST give a person space when they ask" is ridiculous. Let's dive in: Asking for space INHERENTLY requires that other people around the asker explicitly modify THEIR behavior to serve the asker's "need." When you're out in public in a crowded square, is it reasonable to ask everyone in the square for space? No! So why is it suddenly okay to ask YOUR FUCKING ROMANTIC PARTNER FOR SPACE, JUST BECAUSE *THE AVOIDANT* IS THE ONE WHO HAS A DEFICIT IN EMPATHY AND A POOR OR NONEXISTENT CAPACITY FOR INTIMACY AND EVEN CONSIDERING THEIR PARTNER'S NEEDS?! It's PURE fantasy! Unreasonable doesn't even come close, THAT NOTION IS ACTIVELY HARMFUL, ENABLING, AND DESTRUCTIVE! To even THINK that an avoidant - or ANY PERSON - should be able to inherently make a SELFISH REQUEST FOR SPACE, THEREBY REQUIRING AN ACTIVE MODIFICATION OF THE BEHAVIOR OF ALL OF THOSE AROUND THEM, JUST SO THEY CAN HAVE AN EXCUSE TO USE THEIR FAULTY AND UNDEVELOPED EMOTIONAL PROCESSING "SKILLS" IS COMPLETE AND UTTER NONSENSE!!! Space is NOT a "Natural" human need, and only "Normal" when the situation is SEVERLY CONTENTIOUS OR HIGHLY DANGEROUS AND OUT OF THE ORDINARY!



"You are proving to her that you don’t really value her needs as equal to your own. She just told you what she needed and here you are, still talking, still denying her need." is BULLSHIT DARVO. A NORMAL PERSON WOULD CALL OUT THE REQUEST FOR SPACE AS PURE AVOIDANCE MASQUERADING AS A SEEMINGLY "HEALTHY" REQUEST. COMMUNICATING even when things are TOUGH is a NORMAL, ADULT PART OF BEING A HUMAN BEING. An "ANXIOUS" person is NOT AND SHOULD NEVER BE BLAMED OR HELD AT FAULT FOR CONTINUING TO TALK (communication)! 



"The anxious partner has to commit to developing self-soothing capacities while he gives his partner more space to feel safe and heard and that her needs are respected.

So literally the advice given is to DISREGARD CALLING OUT PISS-POOR BEHAVIOR and just WAIT THINGS OUT. What an absolute CROCK of shit. The entire framing of space is just enabling avoidant attachers to CONTINUE TO AVOID.
