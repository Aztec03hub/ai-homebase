It's Tuesday, July 15th, 2025 at 10:45PM: Alyssa showed up to Balkanika. I had already been there for the class, and was in the front entrance area cooling down from the heat of the crowd. I was surprised to see Alyssa and her Mom walk in. No Jesse yet. I noticed a huge tension build up in her upon walking in and seeing me. The vibe was strange, very tense. Alyssa looked a little shocked, and kind of turned away from me and kept walking. I waved to her Mom and said "Hello." She said "Hi" back. Alyssa's mom kinda held back behind Alyssa, and I asked her "Should I not say hello to her?" And Alyssa's Mom definitely struggled to find an answer for a moment, and then finally said "Probably not." I think she was definitely trying to navigate Alyssa's emotional state carefully. So, I went back to dancing.

Even though Alyssa's not a lead, she still kept dancing closer to me. I'd catch her look my way, but then immediately look away if my gaze came too close to hers. It was like her body was magnetically attracted to me. I don't know if she was even aware of it. I kept firm, calm, relaxed, and open body language. Nearly every time I went to dance with a woman, Alyssa would end up on the dancefloor right next to me, or very close, with her partner. At this point, I could feel the tension only continuing to build. Just from Alyssa. Part of me wanted to stay, but more of me wanted to leave so Alyssa's tension would release. I stayed about an hour and a half after they showed up, it was around 10:45PM so I decided to depart. By this point, Jesse (mom's bf) had shown up, him and Debbie were dancing over on my side of the dancefloor. After that song ended, I was ready to go, so I went up and shook their hands, and said "I'm heading out, it was great to see you guys. Hey, is everything alright??" The way Debbie reacted told me she was definitely not prepared for that question. She said "what do you mean" so I said "With Alyssa. Is everything alright with her? Is *she* alright? She seems... Terrified of me. I don't even know if I can say hi to her." Debbie looked slightly strained as she thought for a moment. "Well, You.. you should be able to say Hi. You guys *did* date for a long time... I think something like Hi should be fine... ... But you should just know that she wants to move on." That told me volumes. It was so weird how she said it... Then Jesse shook my hand, kinda pulled me aside closely, and whispered in my ear privately "Just hang in there, bud. Hang in there." and I thought "Wow, that's *definitely* something. He didn't want Debbie to hear him say that." He told me more with that whisper than anyone else could have known... Then Jesse pulled back and smiled a warm smile as he spoke louder "I saw your baptism, that was great! God bless you, I'm praying for you. How do you feel?" I told him "Wonderful. Lots of changes are happening. Thanks, I'm praying for everyone too."

So, I waited for another song to end, walked up to Alyssa, and I shook her hand. She shook mine. And I looked into her eyes, and she looked into mine, at it was nice. I said "Hey Alyssa, it's great to see you again. And I really hope you're well." Then she said "You too. I really hope you're well too." I could sense an ocean of internal tension. Her emotions were clear as day and wound over tight like a strained guitar string. I knew that her attachment system was flaring up at seeing me, being near me. And that she was scared. So I gently smiled at her, and I said "I just wanna let you know, I'm outta here. Goodnight." Soon as I said that, an immediate wave of relief washed over her. She nodded at me. Her tension subsided so clearly. So then I left. On my way to my car, I saw her car parked in the row across from mine. It was unusual for Alyssa to drive there, she normally went with her Mom. I interpreted it as her wanting to drive cuz she knew her Mom was gonna meet up with Jesse anyways. That she probably knew I was likely to be there, and wanted to be able to leave whenever in case things got too intense, without putting a damper on her Mom's night.

I think her shock and immediate turn-away showed that she wasn't emotionally prepared to see me, and got completely activated. But that she still cares. If she truly didn't care, she would have been casual. I think her body being drawn to me on the dancefloor was maybe her subconsciously seeking connection, despite what her self-defense mechanisms were telling her.

Jesse's "hang in there, bud" whisper is huge. He knows something. Jesse wouldn't say that unless he had reason to believe there's hope. He's seeing something in Alyssa that suggests this isn't over.

Now that I think about it, I think her tension during our handshake wasn't fear of *me,* but fear of her own feelings. I think when she looked me in the eye and said "you too, I really hope you're well," she meant it. But she was probably fighting internal chaos the whole time.

Overall, for whatever reason, I feel in my heart that the encounter was good. I showed her consistency. Stability. Non-pursuit. Just a calm presence. I feel like I might have shown her avoidant system that I'm safe, or at least starting to be. I wasn't aggressive, didn't make demands, didn't create drama, didn't have any protest behaviors. I was warm, but still respectful of boundaries. I feel like that's kinda what her nervous system *needs* to see... I think her tension showed me she's fighting her feelings hard. But that the encounter was ultimately restorative. I really hope it was healing.
