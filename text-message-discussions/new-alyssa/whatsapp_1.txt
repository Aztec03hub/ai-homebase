Use your memory to see we were just chatting about New Alyssa and attachment styles in mine and Alyssa's latest text conversations: `Dating and physical attraction`, `New Alyssa and memory search`, `Navigating Attachment Styles in Dating`, and finally `Love languages and attachment styles`.

In any attached screenshots, her texts are all on the left side. Really, you need to use your memory to get context of this.

Please note: any `*****` messages are to be ignored, they are my own notes I added after the fact, so I can help collect my thoughts and note things I want to specifically bring up and reply to with her later.

Message log so far:

[Me:] Is it hard for you to talk about emotions?

[Her:] No not really

[Her:] I like talking about it

[Her:] But there has to be a fine line between

[Her:] Like things need to get done and not get caught up in the emotional side while that is super important

[Her:] I really go by actions than words really. Like projects, working on things together.

[Her:] Wow

[Her:] I really am acts of service

[Me:] Did you have a bad experience opening up emotionally in the past so now you see emotional processing as something that competes with productivity or prevents progress/action? And thank you for being so honest and open with me, I'm grateful.

So if you're acts of service, what are some ways you like to show you care for someone? And what kinds of actions make you feel cared for?

[Her:] That's such a beautiful question. I think I do associate emotional processing with slowing things down sometimes. But I'm learning that the right person makes it feel like both can exist progress and presence. And I feel that with you. ❤️

[Her:] As for acts of service... I show love by anticipating needs like making someone's life smoother, less chaotic. It's my way of saying, 'I've got you.'

[Her:] What makes me feel cared for is when someone takes things off my plate before I ask, or steps in during high stress moments without me having to explain. Or just noticing when I'm tired and doing something thoughtful. That kind of support hits my soul I feel. But I think im also all the love languages. lol I'm a lot.

[Her:] How about you?

[Me:] We are always all of the love languages, I think. My strongest ones are quality time and physical touch, followed shortly thereafter by words of affirmation.

[Me:] Today's track is something special: https://open.spotify.com/track/2SwDxrcsSFe5bbCErtA5VV?si=h-sTo1tcT8qHSugsVnNaow

[Her:] lol wet tshirt?

[Her:] 😏

[Me:] Yeah I saw that and literally thought "Alyssa would look SO bomb in a wet T-shirt..."

[Me:] Those fucking massive, spectacular breasts.. ooh!

[Me:] There's extra magic in the air today, I can feel it already. The air's thick with it. Something wants to manifest.

[Her:] I love these musics you send me

[Her:] It's such a vibe

[Me:] I like to bathe in sound so I'm happy I get to share that with you

[Her:] I love that

[Her:] I wanna bathe with you

[Me:] Okay!

[Her:] Okay my turn! What are your non-negotiables in a relationship?


[Me:] Okay, this will be directly from my heart.

No cheating! I want to feel like a priority, not an option. I have some deep wounds caused by receiving way too many cheating traumas. I'm hyper sensitized to picking up how my partner interacts and is interacted-with by others, and I detect "beyond platonic" interest very easily, and I never want to feel like my person wants somebody over me. I want to be their best choice, their first choice. I don't ever want to feel like somebody could come along and "steal" my partner away, even if it were temporary or in a "heat of passion" type of situation which "shouldn't mean anything." (I don't want to hear "but it didn't mean anything, *they* don't mean to me what *you* mean to me!" ever again). I *do* want to experiment with some group settings, I think... But it's such a scary thought for me I think *because* I haven't spent the time necessary to really process it with the consideration something like that requires. I will *never* trust other men in a setting like that (well, I can never truly say never.. Tren and MDMA can do funny things to confidence, trust, and sexual attraction.). And I will (for now) be highly distrustful of even other women, simply because I've experienced another woman enter mine and a previous partner's life, and proceed to do things with her behind my back (cheating), ultimately leading to her making a proposition to my partner which would've required her leaving me suddenly. If *anything* were to happen with a group setting, I'd want it to be where you and I were absolutely secure with one another, and that we both had a *firm, solid* understanding and agreement that the other woman was there *strictly* for fun, for the extension of each other's pleasure, and that everything possible is done to prevent feelings from being caught. These things require *active and constant and consistent* choice.

Emotional cheating is still cheating to me, too. I wanna be your man, your king, your confidant, your rock, your solid lighthouse in a dark and stormy sea of emotional energy and interpersonal relationships. I don't want any situations where really *anybody* can come between the bond that we build and share. I don't want some habitually single friend of yours who happens to be jealous (of what you have) or parties too much (poor decisionmaking skills) or makes awful life choices (impulsive and selfish) to whisper in your ear and plant seeds which over time cause so many cracks in the foundation of our relationship that the bedrock ultimately crumbles, causing the whole thing to come crashing down.

If I feel uncomfortable with someone around you or talking to you, I'd really *super* like it if you took care of that in the moment, *because you trust me and respect me,* with an understanding that it's not like me to just do things like that to "control" you, but rather because of any or all of the following: the energy I pick up from the situation is off/negative/malicious, past traumas of my own bubbling up and being triggered, or even just feeling 'off' about the situation. Know that I *do* make mistakes sometimes, and sometimes my emotional state *isn't* rational, and sometimes I can and do misread or overthink or misunderstand situations. I am *wrong,* sometimes. But I'll always be open to discussion and talking things out and re-examining my beliefs and the ways I interpret the inputs I receive from the world, and how I process and choose to respond to those inputs. But in the *moment,* I hope that you would do what you could to rectify a situation like that, and reassure me. And as *soon* as we get to a private setting, I'd be all-in for talking about it at length, especially if you believe there's nothing for me to worry about. Me being uncomfortable like that is *extremely* rare, so please know that.

I don't want to be disrespected, belittled, or ignored, *especially* in public. I want my partner to go to bat for me, cuz I'm *her* man, even if I'm being overly emotional or in a weird mood. I don't want to argue or fight in public, I don't think it's appropriate and it's nobody's business but our own. I want us, our *team* to come first, to come before anything else. You are my number one, and I am yours.

More coming, I want to break this up as I think about this more...

[Me:] I don't want lies-by-omission, or passive-aggression. I understand that we're both human, and both will happen regardless, but I'd prefer that we choose to reduce them to the absolute minimum as is possible. And when they do, to own up to it as soon as possible.

I don't like sweeping things under the rug, or avoiding things, or having unfinished business. I like to have the hard, tough conversations earlier than later, and take them head-on.

I need reassurance oftentimes, moreso than other people. It's an effect of my anxious-preoccupied attachment style that I developed as my primary attachment style over the past few years, and although I'm testing as earned-secure, it's still a constant, every day battle for me, and I still get anxiously triggered quite a bit (more than I'd like). I'm just much more resilient and better at managing being in a triggered state, now. So, even just little affirmations told to me go a long way, when my anxiousness surfaces.

I don't want to feel like a success-object. I want to feel like I'm an irreplaceable, one-of-a-kind, amazingly wonderful, emotionally-tuned, incredibly spiritual, super sexy complete rarity of a man.

I don't want broken trust. I don't want broken loyalty. I don't want you to never re-examine your own beliefs or thoughts with me. I don't want you to brush things off if I tell you they're important.

[Me:] I need someone who can talk about feelings when it matters, even if it's uncomfortable. Someone whose actions match their words. Someone who respects boundaries without punishment or guilt. Someone who's willing to work on themselves and the relationship. Someone who shows up, not someone I have to chase (unless the chasing is simply playful, then I like that). Someone who puts in mutual effort. I wanna feel safe being vulnerable, without any possibility of it being used against me later.

[Me:] I need someone willing to explore. Explore themselves, explore me, explore pushing their limits, explore transforming themself and myself and each other, willing to experiment, to experience new things, to release ourselves to the other, to surrender to one another, to soul meld, to adventure with.

(Then, in reply to her earlier question to me about what makes *me* feel cared-for (she said "How about you?), I said:)

[Me:] What makes me feel cared for is having someone who listens. Who sits with me through hard moments, who talks those deep talks we already share with one another. Who communicates with me often, and well. Who soothes me with her words when I need it, because she knows me and senses it.

Who holds my hand, who rubs her booty and boobs on me playfully, who twerks on me while standing in lines, who rubs my crotch under the table at restaurants and out generally, *trying* to give me a hardon, who regularly *tries* to make me feel sexy. Who gives me back/arm scratches and head scratches as often as she's willing (the scratches are HUGE MAJOR points for me!). Seriously, someone who will absolutely participate in my fart fetish with me, I want it all the fucking time, I will never get tired of it, it makes me so happy and horny and is such a fucking turn-on for me.

Having someone who takes the time to understand me, to know me, to pick up on my emotions and know my triggers, who can look at me across the room and know what I'm feeling and probably a bit of what I'm thinking *because* we're so soul-bonded, *because* we know one-another so damn well.

Having someone who can and does fill in the gaps I leave, and who lets me do the same for her.

Having someone who remembers our plans, who remembers the intricacies about me and what I like.

Having someone who helps create and maintain the framework for greatness that we both will exist within, who pushes me, and who helps set up the structure I need to flourish in obtaining the resources we'll need to fuel the lifestyle we crave.

Having someone come to the gym with me regularly.

I feel cared for when someone cooks for me. But I love cooking too, and I feel accomplished if they'd let me cook for them sometimes, too.

I feel cared for when my partner really expands strongly into a goddess level of femininity, where she's incredibly and constantly affectionate, supportive, sexy (erotic, even!), playful, kind, nurturing, compassionate, understanding, loving, motivating, and soft.

[Me:] I think that's a pretty good roadmap to my heart. You could think of it as like.. a manual on how to love me well.

[Me:] Also, I want you to know that all of that was pure me.

I didn't use any AI assistance for any part of that, and it took me a long time to type all that out. So I hope you read it all, knowing that I wrote it with the full force of my spiritual fire and heart behind it, and with a smile on my face.

And I hope it puts a smile on your face, too.

[Her:] Wow

[Her:] That's a lot but I'm so happy your explained that

[Her:] I need to take this in but I'm on a van to the north of the island

[Me:] Okay

[Her:] Thank you for being so open with me and sharing all of that

[Her:] I can feel how much thought and heart went into it. You've clearly done a lot of inner work and reflection

[Her:] emotional safety and trust are sacred at least for me, I tried doing hookup before in my early 20's and it felt so empty. If we're aligned, I'm the kind of woman who wants to make her man feel like a king

[Me:] "Well Alyssa, so far it appears that we're *quite* well aligned. Yeah, hookup culture shouldn't even be called culture, I think it's a damaging illusion. A trap, for the unaware. It's *very* empty.

And I really like that about you, that it's your nature to want to make your man feel like a king. 🥰"

[Her:] "while I know we’ll both get triggered from time to time (that’s just being human), I’m someone who values repairing or healing just as much as relating. But at the same time as I know we are being vulnerable with eachother….  I don’t want to be in the habit of being so emotional about things that none of our goals get done."

[Me:] "I'm glad you value those. And I hear you and understand fully and agree, being *overly* emotional about *anything* does more to hamper or harm than to help."

[Her:] "I love that you love deeply."

[Me:] "😍🥰❤️ Thank you."

[Her:] "We can keep exploringgg, no pressure, but I just wanted you to know that I see your heart, not just your history. And I respect both."

[Her:] "Did you have an anxious attachment style before?"

[Me:] "Yes, I did.

[Me:] It started after Danielle.

[Me:] Then with Stef it really was amplified. And then even more amplified with Kate. She was a fearful-avoidant. That's when I started first learning about Attachment Theory, after Kate. I did lots of healing, or so I thought.

And then Bad Alyssa really fucked me up. By the midpoint, I was *terribly* anxious."

[Her:] "I hope your realize you had a type"

[Me:] "Oh yes."

[Her:] "Cause damn

[Her:] That makes me so angry for you"

[Me:] "Well thank you, that's much more empathy than I'm used to normally. I really like it."

[Her:] "Than you’re “use to” ???"

[Her:] wtf Philip"

[Me:] "My dad doesn't have empathy. And many of those "similar type" of women had very little empathy... Or none at all."

[Her:] "Idk why but my gut tells me, there is a root cause with your dad that needs to be addressed"

[Me:] "😄 he's been the focus of all of my brain spotting sessions so far. I've made tidal waves of progress with reliving, dissolving, and then integrating many (most) of those traumatic memories already."

[Her:] "I think we forget that our parents lives are also a first thing for everything for them too.

[Her:] Not to dismiss what or how you felt.

[Her:] It’s just the reality.

[Her:] Cause I have a very similar story with my mum and Tita but I’ve learned to understand that they didn’t know how to express their feelings on a healthy manner.

[Her:] I forgave them because well back then there wasn’t mental health awareness for them to process what they were feeling or how to deal with it."

[Me:] "Understanding that a starving wolf will devour an unattended child due to the wolf's nature and the environmental conditions to make the wolf starve in the first place... It doesn't change the need to remove the child from the wolf. And it surely won't change the wolf's behavior. Forgiving the wolf because of that understanding also doesn't change the fact that if you want that child to live, it must not be around that wolf.

[Me:] My father has a severe and damaging personality disorder. (Malignant Narcissistic Personality Disorder.) He has caused myself and many others lots of trauma, over a very long time. I do understand what contributed to his condition. And I have forgiven him for most of the traumas he's caused. Forgiven him for my own sake, so I can be lighter and move on, and not have to risk my own inner child around the starving wolf which is his ego.

[Me:] You'll meet him at some point.

You'll even say "Wow, he was really charming! That was fun!""

[Her:] "That metaphor really stuck, I get what you’re saying.

[Her:] But it also makes me wonder… do we have to be vulnerable to the wolf? What if we just learn how to move smarter not from fear, but from wisdom?

[Her:] I think forgiveness doesn’t have to mean proximity or exile. Sometimes it means redefining the relationship so the (child) isn’t in danger but the (adult) can stay grounded and civil without giving up power.

[Her:] I say that because for me, I’ve found peace in choosing how close someone gets, not whether they’re in or out completely."

[Me:] "Yes, we can absolutely use our wisdom and experience to prevent any or most vulnerability around the wolf.

And I'm fully picking up what you're putting down. He's not in my life at this moment while I do the work necessary to relive, dissolve, and integrate those memories in which *he was the source of the trauma I experienced.* In my mind's eye, it's like heading home after battle, taking off all my armor, dressing my wounds, discovering there are spiritual wounds too which need desperate attention and a trip to an Oracle to even reveal those wounds, and it would be senseless for me to have to armor back up and even set foot on the battlefield before those spiritual wounds are attended to and dressed as well."

[Her:] taking off armor after battle hahah so raw love it

[Her:] It makes complete sense why you're protecting that space right now.

[Her:] But honestly I woke up with a similar story and said fuck it and didn't let it bother and I hope you get to that state too

[Me:] Actively getting there 😌

[Her:] It's really quite amazing how deep of dive you're really going into this. I know you'd really like to explore this more with us. Would you be open to listening to this audiobook?

[Me:] Yeah!

[Her:] The Courage to Be Disliked

Check out this great listen on Audible.com.

[Her:] https://www.audible.com/pd/B07BRPQ8LW?source_code=ASSORAP0511160006&share_location=player_overflow

[Her:] It helped me a lot and I think it will help you too

[Her:] Actually esh is the one who introduced me to it

[Me:] Lol that book is garbage and harmful. Trauma denial even when lightened with Adlerian psychology drops decades of hard, peer-reviewed neuroscience on its head in favor of what appears to be feel-good ad-copy.

[Her:] Did you listen to it

[Me:] I am, but I'm also reading about it.

[Me:] This book is a trap. I will finish it, but I can feel it.

[Me:] The book literally assumes people are inherently selfish and manufacture symptoms and reasons to avoid responsibility, flat out declaring "trauma does not exist."

That is so woefully outside of reality it's frightening. Even simple thought experiments can objectively prove its premise is false, classical conditioning exists and can and does cause psychosomatic and autonomic reactions completely outside of conscious awareness.

[Her:] Can ya just listen to it without judgement

[Her:] 🙄

[Her:] Good lord

[Me:] I am trying.. it just said "trauma does not exist" and that's like hearing "water is not wet"

[Her:] I get that you're deeply invested in how trauma works and I respect how seriously you take your healing. But for me, not everything has to be analyzed through that lens

[Her:] Sometimes..... things hit because they are simply a reminder that we can shift perspective & CHOOSE empowerment instead of staying tethered to what hurt us.

[Her:] I shared that book because it helped me release some of the heaviness not deny the past

[Her:] I had the same opinion as you

[Her:] You don't have to like it but I think there's value in trying things with an open heart.. not just an analytical mind

[Her:] Anyway, I'm not trying to debate healing styles

[Me:] That's great, and fine, but denying the existence of a real ontological phenomenon is intellectually dishonest

[Her:] just wanted to share something that meant something to me. I love these deep convos with you, but I also value ease.

[Her:] We can go deep without drowning, you know?

[Me:] I'll complete it.

[Her:] The authors are not saying that traumatic events don't happen.

[Her:] We are not determined by our experiences, but by the meaning we give them.

[Her:] It's not the past event itself that defines your present life 👏

[Her:] It's your interpretation, perspective or energy and belief about that event that shapes how you live now 👏

[Me:] I disagree with the position that it's not the past event which defines the present. I believe it's easy to prove that it can exactly be the case. I would consider, however, that the past event doesn't have to define the future.

If John Doe declares bankruptcy in 2024, and his credit is trashed in 2025, his present situation is indeed realized by the prime mover that was the declaration of bankruptcy in the past

[Her:] Philip Yes, the wolf bit you. But you're not the bite. You're the healer now and you don't have to let that bite define your entire life.

[Her:] Just be open minded and listen to the damn book

[Me:] Jane lost a leg from venous constriction brought on by IV heroin use and a resultant infection. Her present need to use a crutch or a prosthetic is a direct result of her past experience with heroin.

[Me:] 🤔

[Her:] Again. The authos is not denying that trauma or painful events happen.

[Her:] No matter what has happened in your life up until now, it should have no bearing on how you live from this point on.

[Her:] It's hard to explain

[Her:] And we can't solve it back and forth like this if you haven't even listened to it yet

[Her:] Just promise to be open minded

[Her:] Papi

[Me:] I posit that denying the past exists is likened to burying ones head in the sand. Or like reading a history book and going into the future thinking history won't repeat itself.

The past doesn't have to define anyone, but I really think that being able to confront, and sit with, and fully process, and integrate that past is an incredibly powerful (if not the most powerful) process one can leverage to build a better future

[Me:] I will though

[Me:] Open mind

[Me: (In reply to her message containing: "No matter what has happened in your life up until now, it should have no bearing on how you live from this point on.")] That's very nice, but it's not reality. There are people who can't look at certain trees because of their experience serving in Vietnam. There are mothers who were raped so horrifically they can't even look at their own children without shaking uncontrollably.

These people can't just decide that their terrorizing past events just aren't going to affect them any longer.

[Her:] There's a difference between processing your past and becoming it. I'm rooting for the part of you that's ready to live beyond the pain not just survive it.

[Her:] And your arguing this "This happened, therefore this is my present"

***** Me accepting and integrating my past does not equate to me *becoming* my past. It's a false dichotomy to suggest that "living beyond the pain of the past" and "just surviving it" can't coexist.. they can. They aren't mutually exclusive.

[Her:] Trauma may be part of your story, but it is not your sentence. You are not what happened to you. You are what you choose to do next.

***** Another false dichotomy. I am what happened to me, *and* what I choose to do next.

[Her:] The trauma is real. But it is not the cause of your current suffering

[Her:] I'm worried that you are gonna let your dad and your past girlfriends affect our relationship

***** What is the root of your fear, here.. why are you worried about that? Because everything I've presented during this discussion shows that my trauma work is *exactly what prevents* those relationships from affecting *our* relationship. If you aren't seeing that, it suggests you're fundamentally misunderstanding that work. Without brainspotting and integration work, I'd be reactive and triggered constantly. I'd be unable to identify patterns. I'd be repeating cycles unconsiously. And worst of all, I'd be emotionally unavailable! But *with* the work, I can be present and intentional *while being able to actively discuss and remember and accept those past events. I can recognize patterns before acting on them. I can communicate my needs clearly from a standpoint of being completely integrated *with* my past. And ultimately, I can show up securely. You seem to be worried about the very thing my healing is designed to prevent, and that's backwards.

[Me:] No, my argument is "that happened, and it contributed to the entire set of all conditions leading up to the point we call the present, and that the thing happened also happens to have certain effects." But there's no claim about being stuck or relegated or doomed to any given outcome.

[Her:] Papi, I don't want to erase your past. I respect it. But I'm also not here to date your past. I'm here with you in this present. I believe in your power to turn pain into wisdom.

[Her:] There's a version of you who uses that past not to build walls, but to build bridges toward love, healing, and trust. I'm rooting for him.

[Me:] Why do you not touch a pan on the stove when it's on?

[Her:] It's not that serious. And that's physical, I know that would hurt me so therefore why would I fucking touch it?

[Her:] I'm not asking you to deny the past or pretend you were ever burned. I'm asking u to see that ur healing power ur ability to choose differently lives in this moment. Not in the event. Not in her, Right here. Right now. That's what the book is really about.

***** That's a straw man fallacy. I never made any claim that my healing power had to or does exist in any particular moment. However, /it does *actually* exist in all timeframes, past, present, *and* future./ The whole point of brain spotting is to "go back in time" by revisiting and quite literally re-experiencing traumatic moments from the past, *choosing a different way to respond than your inner child did back then,* and it's that new choice *made in the present but applied to the past* which acts as the catalyst and main driver for the incredible healing that then takes place. What the book is really about *actually,* is the denial that trauma exists, that there's no value in processing past moments, nor any point in integrating those events in the makeup of a being's complete timeline, and that observable present-day conditions aren't causally rooted in past events. Reducing complex trauma integration work to a simple "be present now" message ignores how evidence based therapies actually work, and that's by engaging with *past, present, and future* in tandem.

[Her:] 🤣🤣

[Me:] Because you know if you touch it, it will be hot and can burn you. If you've burned your hands multiple times, you're going to be even more averse to touching it when it's on. The fact that you have active awareness that in the past you touched a hot pan and got burned doesn't equate to building walls in the present, it just means that you've identified a pattern on a literal physical level. Breaking patterns and habits and addictions generally can't be done just by going "okay, well that's not a thing anymore." and thinking you suddenly won't be affected by the pattern your body has learned.

[Her:] But I'm not sure if you're ready for that growth

***** That's really dismissive and comes off condescending.

[Me:] If I wasn't aware of some of the memories I've integrated, I never would have been able to integrate them. I'd still be experiencing the weird ever present tightness in my chest, and the transferred heart palpitations that for years I had no idea why I was feeling those things. It wasn't until I revisited those past memories, processed them, and integrated them, that suddenly just like magic, the physical manifestations of those memories instantly disappeared.

[Me:] That is learned experience, my direct experience, that past events and memories can and do have effects in the present

[Her:] I honor your lived experience. The physical shifts you described are beautiful proof of what's possible when we process the past.
But my question is: once it's processed, will you choose to let it continue shaping your love, your trust, and your relationships?

[Me:] Once processed, it ceases to have any psychosomatic effect at all. It is "dissolved," in a sense.

But the experience of it was still lived by me; it's forever a part of my history. And so, it is forever a part of me. But that doesn't mean it has any bearing whatsoever on me, or my future, or my choices, /outside/ of being great pattern-recognition to know "I should avoid that" or "that experience hurts, I should try to prevent it from happening again" or most valuable: "this experience is similar to another's, I can empathize with them to connect and even help them heal"

[Her:] I'm not asking you to pretend it didn't happen. I'm asking you to reclaim the throne. Your body remembers. I get that. But your soul is allowed to rewrite the story from here.

[Me:] When you nick a cut into the node of where a branch grows off from the stem, the nick will heal over a cap, and the branch grows thicker as a result. Thicker and stronger.

[Me:] The cap will always be there, but the branch will forever be stronger.

[Me:] That's why my dick is the way it is. 🤔

[Me:] Ultimately, the book is invalidating of my entire healing journey, which itself is based on empirically-supported psychological and therapeutic modalities. I think some of the content might be useful to people who have issues setting boundaries. But it's terribly dangerous to anyone with trauma experience. It would exacerbate any avoidant's suppression of emotions and could probably prevent real trauma victims from actually seeking help due to increased shame. Marginalized groups likely wouldn't support it, because the book suggests that systemic inequalities don't exist, thus their oppression doesn't exist.

[Me:] I'm on chapter 5.

[Her:] I believe you make it exist but you can make any life exist when you put the right energy out there.

***** That's more deflection.

[Me:] Well, this is concerning. You didn't engage with a single thing I just said. I gave a thoughtful, nuanced explanation of why the book is problematic, but you responded with a pure manifestation platitude that just reasserts the exact premise I just dismantled.

I know you like manifestation culture and the law of attraction. The idea that you create your reality through your thoughts and energy. But even that requires nuance and an understanding of natural limitations. Without that, and when applied to trauma, the message becomes "if you're still affected by trauma, you're just putting out the wrong energy. Just put out the right energy, and you'll create a different life."

This is victim blaming dressed in spiritual language.

It literally tells trauma survivors "Your continued suffering is your fault. You're choosing it by having the wrong energy. Just put out the right energy."

Imagine telling an LGBTQIA+ teen that their ostracization from school or their own family was due to them manifesting it, because they put out the wrong energy... That wouldn't go over so well.

[Her:] I think we're circling the same truth from different sides... you're honoring the impact of trauma, and I'm holding space for the possibility of choosing beyond it. I believe both are real and necessary.

[Her:] My intention was never to spiritual bypass your pain.

***** I get that it wasn't your intention, and I appreciate you naming it. But intent and impact are different things. When you say 'I believe you make it exist but you can make any life exist when you put the right energy out there' in response to me explaining why the book invalidates trauma survivors, that *is* spiritual bypassing, regardless of intention. It essentially means 'Your suffering continues because you're not manifesting correctly.' That's exactly what spiritual bypassing does, it takes the burden off addressing real wounds and places it on the victim's 'energy' or 'vibration' or 'mindset.'

[Her:] I just don't want to see it get to steer your future. You deserve joy that isn't filtered through survival mode. But i think it might be hard to see it in your perspective.

[Her:] I just got back from the ride so I couldn't fully respond to your text until later

[Her:] I felt a really big earthquake!

[Her:] I like this one! A vibe

[Me:] I really don't like how you still won't engage with any of my critiques or examples, and instead just deflect. I do have some replies I think are important...

[Replies to her messages follow:]

[Her:] And your arguing this "This happened, therefore this is my present"

***** Me accepting and integrating my past does not equate to me *becoming* my past. It's a false dichotomy to suggest that "living beyond the pain of the past" and "just surviving it" can't coexist.. they can. They aren't mutually exclusive.

[Her:] Trauma may be part of your story, but it is not your sentence. You are not what happened to you. You are what you choose to do next.

***** Another false dichotomy. I am what happened to me, *and* what I choose to do next.

[Her:] I'm worried that you are gonna let your dad and your past girlfriends affect our relationship

***** What is the root of your fear, here.. why are you worried about that? Because everything I've presented during this discussion shows that my trauma work is *exactly what prevents* those relationships from affecting *our* relationship. If you aren't seeing that, it suggests you're fundamentally misunderstanding that work. Without brainspotting and integration work, I'd be reactive and triggered constantly. I'd be unable to identify patterns. I'd be repeating cycles unconsiously. And worst of all, I'd be emotionally unavailable! But *with* the work, I can be present and intentional *while being able to actively discuss and remember and accept those past events. I can recognize patterns before acting on them. I can communicate my needs clearly from a standpoint of being completely integrated *with* my past. And ultimately, I can show up securely. You seem to be worried about the very thing my healing is designed to prevent, and that's backwards.

[Her:] I'm not asking you to deny the past or pretend you were ever burned. I'm asking u to see that ur healing power ur ability to choose differently lives in this moment. Not in the event. Not in her, Right here. Right now. That's what the book is really about.

***** That's a straw man fallacy. I never made any claim that my healing power had to or does exist in any particular moment. However, _it does_ *actually* _exist in all timeframes, past, present,_ *and* _future._ The whole point of brain spotting is to "go back in time" by revisiting and quite literally re-experiencing traumatic moments from the past, *choosing a different way to respond than your inner child did back then,* and it's that new choice *made in the present but applied to the past* which acts as the catalyst and main driver for the incredible healing that then takes place. What the book is really about *actually,* is the denial that trauma exists, that there's no value in processing past moments, nor any point in integrating those events in the makeup of a being's complete timeline, and that observable present-day conditions aren't causally rooted in past events. Reducing complex trauma integration work to a simple "be present now" message ignores how evidence based therapies actually work, and that's by engaging with *past, present, and future* in tandem.

[Her:] But I'm not sure if you're ready for that growth

***** That's really dismissive and comes off condescending. You're positioning a pop-psychology book as more 'evolved' than evidence-based trauma therapy. That's not just wrong, it's arrogant.

[Her:] I believe you make it exist but you can make any life exist when you put the right energy out there.

***** That's more deflection.

[Her:] My intention was never to spiritual bypass your pain.

***** I get that it wasn't your intention, and I appreciate you naming it. But intent and impact are different things. When you say 'I believe you make it exist but you can make any life exist when you put the right energy out there' in response to me explaining why the book invalidates trauma survivors, that *is* spiritual bypassing, regardless of intention. It essentially means 'Your suffering continues because you're not manifesting correctly.' That's exactly what spiritual bypassing does, it takes the burden off addressing real wounds and places it on the victim's 'energy' or 'vibration' or 'mindset.'

[End of replies to her messages.]

[Me:] Beyond that, you still haven't engaged with any of the substance I shared... The Vietnam vet who can't look at certain trees. The rape survivor who shakes looking at her own children. The LGBTQIA+ teen ostracized by their family. The book's denial that systemic oppression exists. 

Instead of addressing those *realities,* you responded with 'put the right energy out there.' That's not 'circling the same truth from different sides,' that's dismissing what I said entirely.

[Me:] I'm not asking you to become a trauma expert. I'm asking you to respect that my healing journey is evidence-based and effective, and that pop-psychology manifestation books that deny trauma exists are fundamentally incompatible with the deep work I'm doing.

[Me:] Can you understand why 'I'm not sure if you're ready for that growth' felt condescending? My growth *is* the brainspotting/integration work/therapy. The book you're recommending tells me to reject all of that and 'just choose better energy.'

[Me:] I'll finish the book with an open mind like I promised. But I need you to hear me when I explain _why_ something is harmful, not deflect with 'that wasn't my intention' or suggest I'm not open-minded enough to receive the wisdom.

[Me:] I respect that the book helped you release heaviness. But it *is dangerous* to people with complex trauma. And I need you to be able to hold that truth *alongside* your positive experience with it.
