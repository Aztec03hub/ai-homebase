I tried my best to get back to you, i did not want to guarantee that in case it did not work out. I feel like we had this whole conversation about helping me with my fears and concerns and then something happens that literally reminds me of them. You felt one way and told me another. I wish you would have stayed home and waited for me. I am hoping you can help me understand the break down here because i feel really confused, sad and disappointed i supported my mom and tried to make you happy to and you went to your moms making sure i could not come back to cuddle you tonight
Received	06/05/2025 1:03:20 AM	+18152604987	It feels like you lied to me you told me one thing and felt another and even mentioned me coming back but you left. Things are changing i don't like it. We had such an amazing night. I would love to know what happened. Why you did not tell me the truth. When things will go back to normal

Received	06/05/2025 11:05:16 AM	+18152604987	Why won't you talk to me or text me. I feel concerned about last night
Sent	06/05/2025 11:13:13 AM	+18152604987	I need to clear some things up. I never lied to you, I told you calmly and exactly how I felt in the moment. When you left, I genuinely thought I'd be okay. But after you walked away without even kissing me goodbye while accusing me of not wanting you to support your mom, I felt like shit. That hurt deeply. I went to my mom's because I couldn't sleep feeling that abandoned and misunderstood. Not to punish you or prevent you from coming back, but because I needed to take care of myself after feeling completely dismissed. You told me you wouldn't come back even if you finished quickly with your mom, so I had no reason to wait around. I NEVER had an issue with you supporting your mom. What bothered me was you repeatedly accusing me of that when it wasn't true, and you refusing to even consider calling her first in front of me to see what she actually needed. You kept putting words in my mouth that I never said. From my point of view, the breakdown here is simple: You decided I was the bad guy no matter what I said, ignored my actual words, and left. I felt hurt and took care of myself by going somewhere I could actually sleep. That's not lying - that's responding to how the situation evolved. I love you and want to work through this, but we need to stop assuming the worst about each other's intentions. Next time this happens, this will be my answer: "I support you doing what you think is best for your family. I'll miss you tonight, but I understand." and then you can make your choice on what to do afterwards.
Sent	06/05/2025 11:14:33 AM	+18152604987	Now, I'm at work, and my boss is very upset with me, and he's watching me like a hawk, so I can't talk. I can talk more about this after work, if you'd like. I love you.
Received	06/05/2025 11:21:16 AM	+18152604987	I didn't not kiss you i did kiss you i never said i was not going to come back i said i wasn't sure i almost surprised you...i would have gone to an empty apartment. I stood by my mom and tried to make both happy and you left. You promised me you were not upset. I love you i just don't want this to keep happening. I felt like we were so connected and now this i feel so empty
Sent	06/05/2025 11:25:52 AM	+18152604987	I followed you outside specifically because you didn't kiss me. I literally asked 'I can't get a kiss?' and you kept walking while saying I didn't want you to be there for your mom. That happened. You also told me you wouldn't come back because you 'wouldn't want her to feel like I just came by to do that real quick without really caring.' Those were your exact words when I asked if you could come back after helping her. I didn't promise I wouldn't be upset - I said I wouldn't be mad, and I'm not. Being hurt when someone walks away from you isn't the same as being upset with their choices. I need to focus on work now. We can talk later, but we need to stick to what actually happened, not revised versions.
Received	06/05/2025 11:28:16 AM	+18152604987	We need to talk this out because you should have stayed home and waited for me to come back. I did kiss you and now i know tonight I won't be able to see you because you probably won't have the energy to come see my and work

Also what happened to our weekly check ins those have not happened? I like you idea on what to say next time but what will stop you from leaving and allow a world that i can come back to you
Sent	06/05/2025 11:39:55 AM	+18152604987	I need to be clear about a few things: 1) Yes, you kissed me on the couch. I'm talking about when I followed you outside and asked 'I can't get a kiss?' as you were leaving. You kept walking. That's the non-kiss I'm referring to. 2) I couldn't 'stay home and wait' for someone who told me they wouldn't come back because they 'wouldn't want her (your Mom) to feel like I just came by to do that real quick without really caring.' Your words. 3) I did tell you I wasn't upset - and I wasn't upset AT you wanting to help your mom. I was hurt by you walking away while accusing me of something untrue. There's a difference. 4) Of course this is important to me. I'm literally risking my job texting you right now with my boss watching me. How is that not showing importance? I'm reading every word you write. I need you to read mine too. We're talking past each other and it's making everything worse. I'll call you after work. But we need to have an actual conversation where we both listen to what the other is actually saying, not what we think they mean. Now I really need to focus on not losing my job. I love you.

Sent	06/05/2025 11:50:08 AM	+18152604987	You just said: "Also i never heard you say anything or i would have given you a kiss, whats going to happen if we live together are you going to run to your moms when you don't like something i do or i want to be there for my family? Also what happened to our weekly check ins those have not happened? I like you idea on what to say next time but what will stop you from leaving and allow a world that i can come back to you" and I need to address this. 1) You're using my own words against me - I asked you last night what would happen if we lived together and your mom needed you. Now you're throwing that back at me. The difference is I went to my mom's AFTER you left and told me you weren't coming back, not INSTEAD of working things out with you. 2) You keep saying I have a problem with you being there for your family. I've told you repeatedly - I DON'T. I support family 100%. What I had a problem with was you accusing me of something that wasn't true. Please stop putting those words in my mouth. 3) The weekly check-ins haven't happened because you've been joining me at my therapy sessions. We can't have a check-in about therapy when you're literally there during it. That's not fair to bring up. 4) I didn't 'run to my mom's because I didn't like something you did.' I went there because after you left (saying you wouldn't return), I was too hurt to sleep in my own bed. That's not running away - that's self-care after being abandoned. 5) What will allow a world where you can come back? Simple: Don't tell me you're not coming back. Don't walk away without a goodbye kiss while accusing me of things. Communicate clearly about your actual intentions. I heard you call out about the kiss and respond accusing me of not wanting you to go be there for your family. You were already halfway down the sidewalk. You heard me, then the moment had passed. My boss is now standing over my shoulder. I have to go. We'll talk after work.

Received	06/05/2025 11:57:57 AM	+18152604987	If this is what this is all about i didn't hear you i promise i didn't. I wanted to come back i didn't know i was going to be able to. And i feel like instead of hearing me feeling hurt by you leaving and not letting me come back you are saying i did something that i didn't do. Where is the emotion for me?
Sent	06/05/2025 12:16:32 PM	+18152604987	I need to respond with more points so I don't let this issue become disorganized. 1) You responded to me saying 'I can't get a kiss?' by saying 'You don't want me to be there for my mom when she needs me.' as you walked away. That's a direct response to what I said. How can you respond to something you didn't hear? 2) You're asking 'where is the emotion for me?' while I'm actively risking my job to communicate with you. I've expressed hurt, pain, and love throughout this conversation. The emotion has been there the entire time. 3) You say I'm 'not letting you come back' - but YOU told me you wouldn't come back. Your exact words were you 'wouldn't want her to feel like I just came by to do that real quick without really caring.' I can't prevent something you already said you wouldn't do. 4) You haven't addressed a single one of my 5 points from my last message. Not one. Instead, you're creating new narratives about me not showing emotion or preventing your return. 5) What exactly do you think I'm saying you didn't do? Please clarify, because I've been very specific about what happened. This pattern where I state facts, you deny them, then create new accusations without addressing my points - this is what's destroying our communication. For example: I stated: 'You walked away without kissing me goodbye.' You denied: 'I didn't not kiss you i did kiss you.' I stated: 'You told me you wouldn't come back.' You denied: 'i never said i was not going to come back.' I clarified: 'I wasn't upset AT you wanting to help your mom.' You ignored this and accused: 'are you going to run to your moms when you don't like something i do or i want to be there for my family?' I explained: 'The weekly check-ins haven't happened because you've been joining me at therapy.' You never acknowledged this. Each time I clarify, you don't address it - you just create new accusations. This needs to stop. I also need to address the bigger pattern here: Tuesday: You guilt-tripped me for needing rest after therapy, suggesting I was punishing you when I was just emotionally exhausted Wednesday: You accused me of not wanting you to support your mom, despite my repeated clarifications Today: You're rewriting what happened and making me defend basic reality This isn't healthy. I'm stating facts while you're assigning malicious motives to my actions that don't exist. When I went to my mom's for self-care, you frame it as punishment. When I express hurt, you ask 'where's the emotion for me?' When I clarify what happened, you say I'm not hearing your feelings. This dynamic has to change.

Sent	06/05/2025 1:08:52 PM	+18152604987	Sweetie, you're misunderstanding again. I don't feel this way about our entire week - we had an amazing time at Jonny Cabs before this happened. I'm talking about this specific pattern of communication that started when you left last night. What I'm saying is that THIS DYNAMIC - where I state facts and you deny them, where you assign negative motives to my actions, where we can't agree on basic reality - THIS is unhealthy. Not us, not our relationship as a whole, but THIS PATTERN. I'm not saying I'm unhappy with you or want to end things. I'm saying we need to fix how we communicate during conflicts. There's a huge difference. You're doing it again right now - taking 'this communication pattern is unhealthy' and turning it into 'you think our whole relationship is unhealthy.' That's exactly the kind of misinterpretation I'm talking about. Regarding the kiss (whether you heard me or not isn't even the main issue anymore) you're fixating on this one detail while ignoring everything else. You still won't acknowledge that you told me you wouldn't come back. You still won't address your false accusations about me not wanting you to support your family/mom. You're cherry-picking one point while ignoring the bigger picture and not addressing any of my other points. And now you're saying I think we're not healthy when I specifically said this PATTERN isn't healthy. Also, saying "I'm sorry you feel this is not healthy" is not an apology - it's dismissive. You're making it sound like the problem is my feelings, not the actual unhealthy dynamic. A real acknowledgment would be "I see how this pattern is unhealthy" not "sorry you feel that way." I love you. I want to work through this WITH you. But we need to acknowledge the problem first. When you deny things that happened or put words in my mouth, it makes resolution impossible.

I still would like you to call me after work. Just right now i feel like i want to cry because i am trying my best and giving you my all.
Sent	06/05/2025 1:40:24 PM	+18152604987	Sweetie, I see all your messages (even the ones you tried to edit to '.') and I want you to know it's okay to feel overwhelmed. You don't need to hide your feelings from me. First and most important: I love you deeply. Nothing about this conflict changes that. You're not "messing up" - we're both learning how to communicate better during tough moments. When I say this dynamic is unhealthy, I mean the way we're talking past each other during conflicts - NOT our relationship. Think of it like this: if your car makes a weird noise, saying "that sound is bad" doesn't mean the whole car is bad. It means we need to fix that specific issue. You're showing incredible growth right now by saying "I can see how this pattern is unhealthy." That takes real courage, and I'm proud of you for that acknowledgment. I don't want you to shut down. What I want is for us to build better ways to handle disagreements. Remember last night when we discussed therapy in different forms, and you were open to some? How both individual and maybe some couples session could help us to learn healthy conflict resolution? That's exactly what could help us break these patterns - not because we're broken, but because we both deserve better tools for tough conversations. I think we could even start by using a small portion of my own therapy session time to try to establish healthier conflict resolution patterns. I think it could really benefit both of us together, but you would have to be willing. Instead of editing messages after sending them, maybe take an extra minute before hitting send? It's okay to need time to think. I'd rather wait for your real thoughts than have you feel like you need to hide them. Here's what I know: I love you, you love me, and we both want this to work. The fact that we're having this hard conversation means we care enough to fix things, not that we're doomed. Can we agree that this specific pattern needs work, while also agreeing that we're in this together? I'm not going anywhere. I just want us to communicate in ways that don't hurt us both. What would help you feel less shut down right now? (Outside of talking on the phone, you know I can't do that right now, sweetheart.)

Sent	06/05/2025 1:44:43 PM	+18152604987	Sweetie, I want to address what you just said: About Tuesday - when I told you I was emotionally drained from therapy and needed rest, you responded by questioning if we spent too much time together and suggesting maybe we shouldn't see each other Wednesday. That felt like punishment for setting a boundary. I understand you miss me visiting at work, and your feelings are valid. But there's a difference between 'I miss you visiting' and 'Is it because we spent too much time together?' You ARE trying your best and giving me your all - I see that and I love you for it. This isn't about you being a bad person. It's about both of us learning better ways to express our needs without hurting each other. You're not 'causing' an unhealthy dynamic alone - we're both contributing to it. When emotions run high, we both say things that hurt. That's why getting help to learn better tools isn't blame - it's growth. I will absolutely call you after work. And I want you to know: you feeling sad doesn't mean you're bad. It means you care. That's actually beautiful, even when it hurts. We're going to get through this together. I promise.
Sent	06/05/2025 1:46:42 PM	+18152604987	I don't think any part of US is unhealthy. I think we sometimes use unhealthy communication patterns when we're hurt or scared. There's a big difference. WE are beautiful. Our love is real. Our connection is special. The patterns we fall into during conflict? Those need work. But that's like saying we need to learn to dance better together - it doesn't mean we're bad people or wrong for each other. You and me, we're good. The way we sometimes hurt each other with words when upset? That's what needs fixing. I love you. All of you. Even the parts that are still learning. ❤️
Received	06/05/2025 1:46:52 PM	+18152604987	I don't want to take up your therapy time for me. I am still undecided on therapy. I just feel bad right now and it won't get better until i know you don't think any part of us is unhealthy. And that you don't think i guilt tripped you but those are your feelings.

Sent	06/05/2025 1:59:43 PM	+18152604987	Sweetie, I need to lovingly point something out. When you say your feelings 'won't get better until I know you don't think any part of us is unhealthy,' that's concerning. Your emotional wellbeing shouldn't depend on my exact thoughts or words. That's actually an unhealthy pattern itself - making your feelings contingent on controlling what I think. Let me be crystal clear: US = healthy, beautiful, worth fighting for Our LOVE = healthy, real, special Our RELATIONSHIP = healthy and growing Some COMMUNICATION PATTERNS during conflict = unhealthy and need work These are completely different things. It's like saying 'our house is beautiful but the squeaky door needs oil.' The door isn't the house. About therapy - you wouldn't be 'taking up' my time. Learning healthy conflict resolution would benefit ME enormously. It's something I need for my own growth. Having you there for that part would be a gift to both of us. Regarding Tuesday - when someone says they need rest and the response is 'maybe we shouldn't see each other tomorrow then,' that feels like emotional consequences for boundary-setting. We can disagree on the word 'guilt-trip,' but can we agree the interaction hurt us both? Your feelings matter, but they can't be dependent on me never identifying problems. That would mean we could never grow or improve anything. I need you to really hear this: Identifying a problem pattern is not attacking our relationship. It's protecting it.
Sent	06/05/2025 2:02:29 PM	+18152604987	You didn't say anything wrong, sweetie. I was just responding to your previous messages - there's a delay when I'm typing longer responses. I'm really glad to hear you say 'I don't want that to be present in our relationship anymore.' That's exactly what I want too! We're on the same team here. That's why I think getting some professional help with communication tools could be so powerful for us. I understand you're feeling shut down and that's okay. Sometimes we need to sit with difficult feelings. I'm not trying to 'fix' your shut down feeling - I'm just trying to be clear about where I'm coming from. What matters is: We both see the unhealthy patterns We both want them gone We both love each other enough to work on this You don't need to respond to everything right now. Take time to process. I'll call you after work like promised, and we can talk through whatever you need. Just remember - you're not in trouble, you're not bad, and you're not losing me. We're just two people who love each other learning how to do conflict better. And I love you! ❤️

Sent	06/05/2025 2:16:11 PM	+18152604987	Alyssa, my darling, please read what I actually wrote. I said: 'We can disagree on the word guilt-trip, but can we agree the interaction hurt us both?' That's literally me saying we DON'T have to agree on that term. I'm trying to move past the label to focus on the hurt we both felt. You're asking 'so you still think I guilt tripped you' when I explicitly said we can disagree on that word. This is exactly the pattern I'm talking about - you're responding to something I didn't communicate. You say 'now you're calling it a guilt trip' but I literally just said we can use different words. I'm NOT calling it that now - I'm saying let's move past the terminology. I'm not 'picking things out about you.' Tuesday came up because it was within the context of an unhealthy pattern. I was responding to show a direct, recent example of my stating facts while you assigned malicious motives to my actions that don't exist. How can this get better today? Start by reading what I'm actually writing, not what you fear I might mean. I'm trying to meet you halfway, but you're arguing with things I'm not saying. I know you feel sick. This is hard. But please.. actually read my words. I'm trying to move us forward, not backward. What I actually said: 'We can disagree on the word.' What you heard: 'You guilt tripped me.' This disconnect is what I mean by unhealthy patterns. Can you see the difference?

Sent	06/05/2025 2:50:49 PM	+18152604987	I need to address several things: 1) You asked 'what do you need to make this better today?' I already answered: We need to acknowledge the communication patterns and work on them together. You're asking questions I've already answered multiple times. 2) 'Why are you doing all of this now?' - Because I cannot talk on the phone about non-work things during work, especially today with my boss already upset at me. Texting is already going way out of bounds, but it's the best I can do. Plus, texting allows me to fully digest what you're saying, think about it, and organize my thoughts calmly and clearly without forgetting anything or getting overly emotional. 3) 'I deserved an in person conversation' - I've told you multiple times I'll call after work. You started today with 'Call me when you can this is important' at 8:55am and 11:05am asking 'Why won't you talk to me or text me.' I've been risking my job all day to communicate with you in a way YOU said was okay. Responding calmly via text when phone calls aren't possible should be completely appropriate. 4) Your apology means something to me, truly. But following 'I'm sorry' with 'I don't want to do this anymore' is exactly another negative pattern... Apologizing just to "make it go away" rather than actually addressing the issues is not healthy, and it doesn't actually solve anything for future, or do anything to prevent problems from happening again later. What I've been trying to do: Identify patterns so we can fix them together. What you're hearing: Attacks that need to stop. You say you're reading my words and meeting me halfway, but you haven't acknowledged a single specific point I've made. Not one. You keep asking questions I've already answered and making new accusations ('why now,' 'not fair') instead of engaging with what I'm actually saying. Breaking these patterns requires BOTH of us to: Acknowledge what actually happened Stop assigning malicious intent Actually engage with each other's points Work toward solutions I can't do this alone. 'I don't want to do this anymore' isn't meeting me halfway - it's giving up.

We have already talked through Tuesday I have apologized for having to leave for saying you did not want me to support my mom. I have apologized for hurting you. I have made it clear i did not hear you about this kiss. I agree that i want to work through this. What more are you looking for
Received	06/05/2025 2:58:52 PM	+18152604987	This has been very overwhelming and who wants to hear they hurt their partner. This should have been a conversation in person and i believe you see that too. I don't like doing this over text message. What more do you need from me?
Sent	06/05/2025 4:07:22 PM	+18152604987	You asked me to stop, I agreed, then you sent two more messages. I'm responding because you asked direct questions. What more am I looking for? 1) Acknowledgment of YOUR role in the patterns, not just that they exist. Saying 'I can see how this pattern is unhealthy' (which you tried to edit to '.') isn't the same as 'I contributed to this pattern by X, Y, Z.' For example, the pattern of "stating facts vs. assigning malicious intent": - You could say "I contributed to the pattern of assigning punitive intent by saying 'you went to your moms making sure i could not come back to cuddle you tonight' when you left to go to your Mom's so you could sleep better." - You could say "I contributed to the pattern of assigning intent by saying 'You don't want me to be there for my family/Mom' when you tried to discuss communication patterns, after you repeatedly told me that wasn't the case." The pattern of "denying reality": - You could say "I contributed to the pattern of denying reality by saying 'i never said i was not going to come back' when you pointed out that it was unfair for me to expect you to have stayed home after I left, and especially after I said 'I wouldn't want her (my mom) to feel like I just came by to do that real quick.'" The pattern of "deflecting instead of addressing points": - You could say "I contributed to deflecting by asking 'what happened to our weekly check ins' when you were trying to address our communication issues, even though I've been joining your therapy sessions." - You could say "I contributed to deflecting by saying 'Why are you doing all of this now' and 'I deserved an in person conversation' instead of addressing the actual patterns you were pointing out." 2) Commitment to specific changes. Acknowledging a problem without planning how to prevent it accomplishes nothing. 3) You to stop insisting this should be in person. I've explained multiple times: I can't call at work, texting helps me organize thoughts, and having a written record prevents inconsistencies and allows me to prove what exactly it is that I say. Besides, you texted me at 11:05am asking 'Why won't you talk to me or text me' - THAT indicates that texting was acceptable. (Now suddenly it isn't...?) 4) Actual engagement with my points instead of checkbox apologies. You still haven't acknowledged: - That you told me you wouldn't come back: "wouldn't want her to feel like I just came by to do that real quick without really caring" - That I supported you helping your mom: "I NEVER had an issue with you supporting your mom" - That making your emotional wellbeing dependent on my thoughts ("it won't get better until i know you don't think any part of us is unhealthy") is itself unhealthy - That you've repeatedly asked questions I already answered ("what do you need to make this better") - That you haven't engaged with ANY of my 5 numbered points from earlier: * Point 1: About you using my words against me * Point 2: About me repeatedly saying I DON'T have a problem with you supporting family * Point 3: About weekly check-ins not happening because you join my therapy * Point 4: About me going to my mom's for self-care, not to punish you * Point 5: About what would allow you to come back to things being fine (clear communication) You ask 'who wants to hear they hurt their partner?' Nobody. But without communication, nothing changes. That's why we need to talk about these things, even when it's hard. I need text conversations for conflict resolution right now. In person, I can't track all the deflections, topic changes, accusations, and contradictions. I can't change that until I have better DBT skills.

Received	06/05/2025 4:48:03 PM	+18152604987	I have apologized and acknowledged my part in this, now i have taken accountability in this pattern it may not be in the perfect wording but its there.
Received	06/05/2025 4:56:27 PM	+18152604987	Babe? Can you please call me so we can work this out?
Received	06/05/2025 4:58:03 PM	+18152604987	What is going on 😞
Sent	06/05/2025 4:58:51 PM	+18152604987	My love, *EVERYONE* deflects, accuses, and contradicts sometimes.. including me. It's human nature, especially during conflict. The problem isn't that these things happen - the problem is refusing to acknowledge when they do. Saying 'I don't deflect, accuse or contradict' is like saying 'I never make mistakes.' It's not possible. What matters is: Recognizing when it happens Acknowledging it Taking accountability Working to change it When you say 'don't say that about me!' about basic human behaviors we ALL do, you're essentially implying that you're perfect and above normal human communication patterns. That's not realistic or healthy. If you truly believe you NEVER deflect (like changing topics to weekly check-ins when discussing communication), NEVER accuse (like saying I don't want you to support your mom), or NEVER contradict (like denying you said you wouldn't come back), then we have a much bigger problem than communication patterns. The inability to acknowledge basic human flaws means growth is impossible. How can we fix something you won't admit exists? As for accountability - saying 'I apologized' isn't the same as acknowledging specific behaviors. I gave you exact examples of what accountability looks like. General apologies without specific acknowledgment don't create change. I'm not attacking your character. I'm saying we BOTH have these patterns and need to work on them. But that work can't happen if you believe you're above having flaws. Can we please start from 'we're both imperfect humans who sometimes hurt each other' instead of 'I don't do those things'?

Received	06/05/2025 5:46:46 PM	+18152604987	I feel really emotional right now. I am glad we worked this out I hope we are truly okay and this never happens again.
Received	06/05/2025 5:48:44 PM	+18152604987	I am really scared you will keep pointing out things you think are patterns if that happens to our relationship i feel like i will shut down will that happen?
Sent	06/05/2025 5:53:06 PM	+18152604987	I hear you, and I empathize with what you're feeling right now. I am glad and grateful we worked this out, and I'm so proud of you for addressing what you did and letting me tackle things one at a time. From my standpoint, things are truly okay. And I too hope that this never happens again. If it does, then I will try to discuss it in person, as long as I am allowed to slow it down, take notes at my own pace, and be able to address points individually and as they come up. I will always, always communicate any unhealthy patterns to you, and strive to put in the work necessary to make a plan and then put in the work to enact that plan, so that unhealthy patterns are addressed and rectified, so that they don't repeatedly occur. We both owe that to each other to maintain the continued health of our happy relationship. Our partnership. I hope you do not shut down. And if that reveals itself to be a regular risk, then I hope that you will take the necessary steps to try to do whatever you can to prevent those shutdowns. I will of course always try to work with you to prevent them.
