We go dancing every tuesday and thursday night. Tuesdays at Avenue BG, and thursdays at Alhambra Palace in Chicago. Alyssa has danced for 16+ years, salsa bachata, and latin dances. I am just learning. I go because I love dance and want to become a better dancer so I can dance with her!

Our relationship has been rather tenuous lately. Things will be going great, but then suddenly she always manages to seriously screw things up with our relationship, causing chaos, sowing the seeds of distrust and jealousy and possessiveness, being unwilling to take accountability, taking even the slightest things, comments, or memes as personal attacks upon herself or her character, and many times just seeming not to listen to me, like what I say goes in one ear and out the other. Constant looping arguments. All of these are started by her. I constantly have to remind her of the behaviors she's promised to correct but then breaks her promises on. And I have to remind her of things like how she can't control her emotions and they are always valid, but that she can change /how she reacts to them./ I also have to constantly remind her of her consistent black and white thinking. Honestly, I think she may have one or more personality diagnoses, likely BPD, and perhaps narcissistic personality disorder, both of which I have had the misfortune of experiencing in other people close to me throughout life.

Yesterday, she asked me if I'd be mad or upset if she just wanted to stay in and not go to dance practice at Alhambra (dance hall). I told her of course I wouldn't be, that she could have any reason in the world and if she just wanted to stay home, that we would stay home, because I love her. I did ask her why, and she explained that she's been feeling extra possessive of me, she doesn't like it when other girls in the class smile at me, and she claimed that "usually bad things happen when we go." I told her not to manifest anything negative by giving it unnecessary thought, and then reminded her that last time we had gone I thought we had a great time. She thought about it, and eventually got back to me that she'd like to go.

I get off work, I get ready, and pick her up. We had the whole car ride up there, and it was fine. I'm parking underneath the 'L' tracks in downtown chicago, and got close to a pylon, but I saw it and knew we'd be fine, but she shouts out "OMG YOURE GOING TO HIT THAT, STOP!!!!" and it startled me to the extent that she almost caused me to actually hit it. We had had this issue in the past, and I calmly asked her not to tell me how to drive, not to be a backseat driver, and to trust that when I'm operating a motor vehicle to let me operate it. For safety. And that it was a respect issue. She went so far as to promise not to say things like that, because she had indeed almost caused highway issues to exacerbate or appear when they ordinarily wouldn't have if she'd have stayed quiet. So, I calmly asked her "Please don't say things like that, okay?" she got this incredulous look, but only after smiling almost seemingly evilly (I saw this on my dash cam after when reviewing what happened as a sanity check) and took major offense to it, and began claiming quite upset that "You can't talk to me that way!" to which I calmly responded "Sweetie, you promised not to say things like that while driving, please don't tell me how to drive. It's a safety concern."

I thought that was the end of it... but it was not. She wouldn't hold my hand on the way in. I ignored that, and just tried to drop it, like an adult. But the entire night and dance practice she would barely look at me, and would barely speak to me. Salsa class ended so we started going upstairs to bachata class, and I took the opportunity to pull her aside and ask what the heck was going on. Then, in front of lots of strangers, she audibly started to rather loudly say things about "how I can't talk to her that way." (something we also agreed was a boundary based upon respect, and she wouldn't do), and I calmly replied and said "I didn't speak to you poorly, I just asked you not to say what you promised you wouldn't say again." She wouldn't let up, and started to get very disrespectful and escalate things.

These types of things make me mentally shut down. She knows this. And I always told her that if she crossed one of my boundaries and disrespected me, that I would remove myself from the situation. She has constantly tried to get me to go back on this boundary, but for the most part, I have remained firm. I ask her to step outside the class so we could discuss it in private, so we do. She then continued to start interrupting me, twisting things around, and started projecting that I was being disrespectful to her, and gaslighting me! She started saying that I had said things I KNOW I didn't say! Mentally, I overloaded, and started to shut down. Because earlier I had been willing to leave/not even go to Alhambra if she wanted, I told her "I want to work this out, but I can't stay here now, please go grab your things so we can leave, I need this right now."

She absolutely refused. and started to make things worse! It ended up with her calling her mom (her mom and mom's bf usually ends up joining her and I later on thursdays at alhambra), digging her heels in, saying she won't go, and that if I really wanted to go that it was my fault, and that I was breaking a promise by walking out (when I'm enforcing a boundary!) and telling me angrily to grab her things from the car and come give them to her, and that I can forget spending time with her this weekend if I did this.

I remained calm, and said "Sweetie, I want to work this out, but I cannot stay here. You know that. Can we please talk this out on the way home? I was willing to stay home when you needed it, and I need this now."

She turned it around on me, and said this was all my fault, and that I was just going to blame her for it all happening anyways, and no, that I should just leave. I reminded her that if she had just stayed respectful by not trying to backseat-drive, none of this would have happened, and that cause-and-effect matter (a common theme in our arguments, she rarely refuses to acknowledge her part in starting the vast majority of them), and that I really wanted to work through it. She kept turning things around on me, and finally just started walking in without saying anything. 

So, I took a walk to the car. I felt so strange, because I knew that I didn't say the things she said I did in the way she claimed I said them. So I got to my car, and opened up my dashcam app, and I watched the recording of what happened. And just like that, it was confirmed - she was gaslighting me. I had remained calm, and gently asked her not to say things like that, and the only thing that could've been construed poorly was my use of the word "shit."

I sent her a text, still trying to amend things: "Sweetie, if I said some things too aggressively, I'm really sorry. I want to work this through."

no response.

"Honey, can we please agree that we both want to work this out, leave together, and talk this over on the way home? I really want to resolve this with you, together."

Hard no.

So then I asked her if this was what she really wanted. To dance, and not work anything out.

She stopped responding, and I think at that point she blocked me.

So I waited a bit.

And still, I wanted to try try try again. So I went back in. I wanted to see with my own eyes if she was dancing and having a grand old time, smiling without a care, not caring about me at all. And what I saw mortified me. She was dancing and smiling, without a care in the world.

She locked eyes at me, realized I hadn't gone anywhere. The dance ended. She immediately shot her mother a look that read "WTF is HE doing here, he's right over here!" and then she proceeded to ignore me. The photographer came around, and I moved a bit closer, just watching her, hoping she'd come over and make ANY effort to meet me halfway and begin a dialogue. But no. She'd look over, then look at the camera guy, put on a smile, and turn her body away from me, like I didn't exist.

It crushed my soul.

And there I was, right after having seen hard evidence that she was in fact gaslighting me. It destroyed me. I had seen enough. So I left.

She stayed there at the dance hall with her mother and mother's bf until almost midnight, then finally sent me a text:

```Phil, I didn't deserve you walking out on me and disrespecting me again on that. And now you walk back in and don't say hello to my Mom or Jesse and you think I should walk to you. Again very disrespectful```
