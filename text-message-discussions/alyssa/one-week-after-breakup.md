My ex-gf (she left me suddenly about a week ago) has an avoidant attachment style. She completely refused to talk about the breakup, and only texted me "I am sure you understand why we are at this point now and I choose not to discuss any of it anymore. Please respect my decision." I told her I understood, and respect her decision. A few days later, I asked to pick up my spare apartment key from her, she replied via text "Yea of course" so I went over there. We had a (surprising to me) nice conversation, she was smiling, she apologized for telling me "You know what..? Fuck you, Phil." on the phone the day we broke up (that was directly before she sent the "I'm sure you understand" text.), and said she still loved me, and always would, but that right now we wouldn't work. I asked if we could be friendly and if she'd please not completely close the door on me, to at least remain receptive, in the hope that I could work on myself while she worked on herself and not drift completely apart, so that possibly in the future we could try again. She said we would of course be friendly, but didn't directly address keeping the door from completely closing or not. I asked about logistics, like if it was okay for me to continue going to her church. she said yes. I asked about details, that obviously I wouldn't sit right next to her, and asked if she'd be more comfortable with me sitting many rows away, or if she'd want me to sit completely across the room. She said it wouldn't be necessary to sit across the room. I asked if I could still give her the sign of peace during mass, and perhaps wave if I saw her sometimes, and she again didn't directly address the questions, but again indicated that being friendly would be fine. I asked her if I could continue going dancing, as she brought me into the Latin dancing scene, and I fell in love with the hobby. She said of course. I asked if I should avoid her at dances, she said no, just don't make things weird. I asked if there was a possibility of us dancing together - maybe not for a while, obviously, as I reaffirmed her need for space, but eventually. She again didn't directly address it, but indicated that it was possible eventually. I asked if I could still talk to her via text, and check in occasionally, again after some time. She indicated yes. All in all, I thought it ended quite well... but then later that night I sent her a text trying to show my determination to work on myself, and a bit more, and things developed very strangely...:

Phil (Friday, June 13th, 2025 3:52PM): I want to share a little bit of something that shows my determination.

I had no idea what I was doing when I started that project. But I worked hard, and kept trying, and gosh did I make something beautiful out of it. 

This is exactly what I'm going to do to myself. Brick by brick, I'm gonna set a foundation strong as stone and work through each and every one of my issues. 

First for myself. And then for you. And finally for us. 

I will do this. 

Alyssa (Friday, June 13th, 2025 3:57PM): Well that project definitely turned out well. I truly hope you do the work for you. 

Phil (Friday, June 13th, 2025 4:06PM): I am. But it can be for more than me, too. It can be for the people I've hurt without meaning to. It can be for my family who's had to experience picking me up out of it time after time. It can be for my friends who I've stubbornly pushed away and let drift apart until they became strangers. 

And it can be for you (and our possible future, too) for all the times I pushed when I didn't have to. And the times I was stubborn as a mule. And for when I mistakenly put meaning or intent behind your words or actions or reactions that weren't actually there, and that I never took the time to say hey, is this what you mean? Because I'm having an emotional reaction to it and I want to make sure I pick up what you're putting down correctly. And for the times that I* brought up the past after saying I wouldn't, myself be damned for trying to justify it because you may have brought it up first (and for when you didn't even do that!), when I should have been the one to say "Hey, we're about to do that thing that neither of us wanna do, and I want to choose a better way, because I love you." 

Phil (Friday, June 13th, 2025 4:18PM): I love making you happy. And until I get more skills in working out more of the crap that's gummed up my mind, it won't be consistently reliably easy for me to do that. 

And what makes me happiest... Is making you happy. So I have to do it for me, which also happens to benefit you. 

Alyssa (Friday, June 13th, 2025 5:31PM): I appreciate what you are saying and like i said at the house. Right now we will not work. I don't know what the future will hold and i hope you truly take this time and do the work for yourself and no one else. 

Phil (Friday, June 13th, 2025 5:31PM): Yes. 

Phil (Friday, June 13th, 2025 9:12PM): I have a question... Earlier, when you said you'd be happy if I found someone who made me happy while I was working on myself... 

Is there someone else..? 

Alyssa (Friday, June 13th, 2025 9:33PM): No there is no one else. I just want to see you happy

Phil (Friday, June 13th, 2025 9:34PM): Okay. My mind just went all over the place, cuz I know you usually go to Alhambra on Thursday nights, but I didn't see you there. Granted, I only stayed for a little while after the class. But I was sorta hoping I'd see you there and then when I didn't and then we talked today, my mind went all sorts of places. 

Phil (Friday, June 13th, 2025 9:48PM): What I mean is I want to see you happy too! I'm just overthinking things. I thought maybe you didn't go cuz I said I'd go... And that's okay too! 

Also... You make me happy. 

Alyssa (Friday, June 13th, 2025 9:50PM): Hey did you see jesse yesterday at Alhambra?

Phil (Friday, June 13th, 2025 9:50PM): No, and I was looking for him, too

Phil (Friday, June 13th, 2025 9:51PM): I only stayed until about 10 though

Phil (Friday, June 13th, 2025 9:52PM): Did you come later and I missed you all? 

Alyssa (Friday, June 13th, 2025 9:53PM): No me and my mom went to a different place 

Phil (Friday, June 13th, 2025 9:54PM): Oh cool cool. Do you have other places you'd recommend for classes? I know your mom was telling me there's tons of places, like enough to go get free classes every night of the week. 

Phil (Friday, June 13th, 2025 9:55PM): I want to go as much as I can. I'm gonna be doing lots of therapy, dance classes, reading, and debt paying. I already moved most of the important things out of the apartment. But I need more spots to go practice dance at. 

Alyssa (Friday, June 13th, 2025 9:59PM): The places you are currently going to are definitely good. Phil i know based on today what you are hoping for, but i need you to respect where I am at. 

Phil (Friday, June 13th, 2025 10:01PM): I don't quite understand what you mean... I think I do respect where you're at...? From what I know, I'm not in a state that you are able to date right now. And that's okay with me. I just hope that I can do the work necessary to become a better me. One that you'd be proud to date. Some day. No strings attached, no expectations. I hope we can still be friendly. But if anything is too much, I'll back off. I mean, it's not okay with me that I'm in that state, and I'll be doing everything I can to rectify it. But it's completely okay that you don't want to be romantically involved with me right now. I screwed up. Big time. And I pushed you way away because of it. I get that. And I accept it. Just because I'm sorry about it doesn't change that fact. I failed, and I'm gonna let that failure be my teacher. 

I'm gonna keep showing up for myself. And I love you so much I'll never stop trying, always keep going.

I'll respect your wishes in full. Even if they mean I go away forever. Because that's what you mean to me. How much you mean to me. 

I wonder if this is how your Grandpa felt about your Grandma when he saw her at the dance hall. Regardless, I'm gonna depend on myself, and let you depend on yourself. And I won't let my failure consume me, I'm gonna face life. I got this. And I know you got this on your end too, for all of your stuff going on. Sometimes stuff's gotta fall apart so the growth can begin a new phase. 

Anyways, I hope you have a great shift. I'm off to bed, night. 

(Then, the next day, since everything seemed to be going well, I sent her an update)

Phil (Saturday, June 14th, 2025 3:25PM): Hey, I wanted to send an update. I'd like to send them every so often, and please don't feel obligated to respond to them if you don't want to. My intent behind these is to try to maintain a positive connection, and allow you to actually see some of what I'm learning and doing to better myself. I'm fully aware that it's going to be up to me to try to reignite a relationship with you in the future, eventually, when we're both ready. They're meant to try to prevent us from drifting too far apart during that time.

Today I got to mentor Zander more about tool usage. We spent the day power washing and cleaning up the backyard, it was super fulfilling. 

From that book, I'm learning lots about love and how couples have what can be considered a "love bank," and certain actions and experiences with people will either "make a deposit" or "withdrawal" from a person's "account" in your own "love bank." I fully accept that I made too many "withdrawals" of energy from my account in your "love bank," due to the things I said and way I made you feel in the events leading to our separation. I learned that it's my responsibility to try to make some deposits, regularly, if I ever hope to rekindle a romantic love with you. But that they can't be just from one-off things. They need to be consistent, and that consistency will come in due time with the changes I'm steadily making in my life, helped along by therapy. 

I learned that love isn't just based on feelings alone, but it also involves choice. I know you still have love for me - as you even told me - but that right now you can't choose me. And that's okay, I accept it. I choose to continue loving you, and because of that, I will work tirelessly to find ways to try and let you fall in love with me again. And if you continue to let me, I will keep you - no matter what. And I choose to work on myself. I intend to become a new person with this work. And if a time comes where you do start to fall in love with the new me, then I plan to sit down with you and iron out all the wants and needs we both have. So we can truly start fresh. A real, clean relationship, founded on romantic love, mutual understanding, and making one another happy. And choosing each other. One where the scars of the relationship from before are just that: scars healed over. One where we both make regular deposits in the others Love Bank.

Until then, I pledge to maintain a few small, out of the way acts that I'd like to do. Little things I can do to hopefully brighten your day, lift your spirits, and make you happier. I hope you're okay with receiving some letters in the mail. Tiny gestures, like that. They will make me happy, and hopefully make you happy too. Actually, it will make me very happy if I can still make you happy with small acts, sometimes. 

That's all for this update, I know it was long.. others will be brief. I hope you and the family have an awesome time at the comedy show tonight!! I want to send my warm wishes to everyone. I found a dance class tonight, so that's what I'll be doing. And please tell your Dad I wish him a very happy Father's Day tomorrow. 

Have a Happy Heart. ❤️

- Phillip

Alyssa (Saturday, June 14th, 2025 5:08PM): Phil please i am going to ask this last time please stop texting me. I am glad you are working on yourself but we are broken up and you need to leave me alone. I know you understand. 

(Her saying that hurt, and confused me very much, because she had not asked me to stop texting her at any point. I did accept that even though she didn't tell me that before, that she was telling me that then at least, and that I needed to respect that.)

Phil (Saturday, June 14th, 2025 5:10PM): I understand and I will stop. Is there any chance to remain friendly and receptive? I felt like you were open to that when we spoke yesterday, but perhaps I misread. 

Alyssa (Saturday, June 14th, 2025 5:15PM): We need to move on with our lives and it's best that we don't communicate. 

Phil (Saturday, June 14th, 2025 5:17PM): Okay. I hope after time passes you will let the new me communicate with you. I can't stop fighting for the love of my life, even if it means I have to fight the current me. Goodbye.

Since then, I went completely no contact. She was still checking on my social media stories and posts, and in fact was one of the first people to view my stories/posts any time I posted them. It's now Thursday, June 19th, 2025. Last night, I noticed she unfriended me on snapchat, but she still didn't unfriend me on facebook or instagram, and in fact saw a post I posted:

Phil (Facebook post, Wednesday, June 18th, 2025): Had a really tough therapy session today. I'm working on understanding how I react when I'm overwhelmed and the impact that has on people I care about. It's uncomfortable to see these patterns in myself, but they're my responsibility. I'm working on catching myself before I say things I can't take back. This really, really hurts... Please pray for me.

---

I also had facebook put my post on my story, so I could see who viewed it. And sure enough, she was one of the first people to see it.

I knowing that she's got an avoidant attachment style (she told me this fact herself during our relationship), and that they need lots of space during a breakup. So, I decided to completely deactivate my social media (facebook and instagram). I have hope that she just needs time and space in order to process what happened, and I hope that when she does, she may be willing to reach back out to talk about what happened. I know I need to respect her boundaries and needs, and I will. But it's so difficult to have her suddenly completely "drop" me, like I feel like I'm being discarded. And to have her outright tell me she "chooses not to discuss it anymore" when one of the core agreements and alignments during our relationship (and we promised it to each other!) was that we'd always try to talk things out in person, and try everything possible to save the relationship in case anything bad happened, felt incredibly hurtful and jarring. it made me feel like my type of love isn't worth much, because there were so many times I followed through on that promise to her, and took a step back when I was emotionally charged, and made calm, intentional efforts to talk with her about any issues or problems we had, to hear her, and to understand where she was coming from and how she felt during times of crisis or arguments.

Please give me an absolutely majorly lengthy analysis in an artifact, and please include some information on how and/or what her avoidant attachment style affects this, or how it's involved in how things went down, and if there's any chance for us to get back together, and if so, a couple ways how that would look, especially if I want to do things healthily and with full mutual understanding and intent to grow. I'm really hurting right now, and especially because the night after our breakup, I saw a picture of her out dancing, and she looked so happy, which I am glad that she's happy, but it made me feel like she didn't have the same love for me as I had for her, for if she could be so happy, then did she even feel any loss from leaving me? But then, I also temper this thought with the understanding that many avoidants will have a period of "separation elation," where they feel like they've regained complete independence and a complete lack of emotional pressure directly after a breakup, and so feel quite elated and happy, for a time, while simultaneously not processing any of the emotions or loss from the breakup event or even the relationship as a whole.
