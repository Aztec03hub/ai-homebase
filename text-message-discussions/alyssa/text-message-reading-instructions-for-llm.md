Please read the following text messages between myself (Phil) and my ex, Alyssa. According to my therapist, Alyssa likely has an avoidant attachment style, but with heavy anxious attachment features. I used to have a secure attachment style, but I now display many anxious attachment style features. My therapist and I are trying to use you, Claude, to analyze and help understand Mine and Alyssa's text conversations through the lens of understanding attachment theory.
We'd like a comprehensive, thorough analysis on the attached texts with a complex estimate on if we're really through, or if she'll reach back out, as well as the identification of things that support different attachment styles, and special notice of where we have great communication and/or reveal major matching-up and great compatibility.
The format of the messages are:
```
Type	Date		Message Body
```
For example, if you see this:
```
Sent	05/21/2025 11:37:06 PM		What makes you say that, what did I do...?
```
then that indicates the message was sent from Phil to Alyssa.
If you see this:
```
Received	05/21/2025 11:37:38 PM		You get me, your so understanding and kind and you always choose me and us which i love
```
In your comprehensive analysis, please work very hard to support your findings with direct message quotes, which include the entire text structure of:
```
Type:  Date: , Name: , Message: 
```
See the paste for the texts.
